## Malicious URL's Detection
Phishing attacks continue to pose significant threats to online security, targeting unsuspecting users through
deceptive web pages that mimic legitimate sites to steal sensitive information.
This project aims to develop an advanced phishing page detection and mitigation system leveraging Machine Learning (ML) technology, Flask for server-side scripting, and HTML/CSS for crafting deceptive web interfaces.

## Introduction
Our system will replicate common online platform interfaces to lure potential victims into providing sensitive data. By integrating Flask for server-side scripting and HTML/CSS for crafting deceptive web pages, coupled with ML algorithms, we aim to showcase how cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities to harvest user information.

Moreover, the project will highlight the criticality of robust cybersecurity measures, including user awareness training, multi-factor authentication, and real-time phishing detection algorithms, to mitigate risks associated with phishing attacks.

The outcomes of this project will contribute to the development of more secure online environments and deepen understanding of cybercriminal methods. Ultimately, it will enhance overall cybersecurity awareness and preparedness.
## Problem Statement
Detection of malicious URLs and classify the raw URLs into different class types such as benign or safe
URLs, phishing URLs, malware URLs, or defacement URLs.
## Existing and Proposed System
Existing systems for malicious URL detection include blacklisting known threats, heuristic analysis based on
predefined rules, machine learning models trained on URL features, behavioral analysis in sandboxes, and
specialized approaches like phishing detection and web application firewalls.

In the proposed system, we aim to develop an advanced system for the detection of malicious URLs by treating it as a multi-class
classification problem. The primary objective is to classify raw URLs into distinct categories, including
benign or safe URLs, phishing URLs, malware URLs, and defacement URLs.
## Scope

The system's scope includes continuous learning mechanisms to adapt to evolving cyber threats. This ensures
that the model remains effective in identifying and classifying new and emerging patterns of malicious URL
behavior. The proposed system is versatile and can be applied across various industries, including finance,
healthcare, e-commerce, and more. Its adaptability makes it suitable for deployment in diverse organizational
contexts.
